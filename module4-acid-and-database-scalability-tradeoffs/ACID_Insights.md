# ACID, Document-Based Databases, and Flexibility


## - SQLite & PostgreSQL
- What was easy about using this technology?
The keywords and functionality of these tables was intuitive and straight-forward. Selection, joining, and summarization of tables has very specific syntax that is unique to SQL. The only difference between the two is the API keys necessary to connect with ElephantSQL and Heroku; SQLite does not have to worry about such things.

- What was hard about using this technology?
The only difficult part of using SQL syntax is figuring out the order of terms. There is a specific building block for how the queries are formatted and the errors are not always the most informative.

- What more would you like to learn about it?
The outputs can sometimes be a little messy; I would like to find simple ways to clean up the output produced within a Python file (this might likely involve for loops).


## - MongoDB and Document-Oriented Databases
- What was easy about using this technology?
Understanding dictionaries is a big key to developing document-related databases. After connecting to the server, which seems to be half the battle, the rest is simply about finding out how to transform whatever data one is working with (I transformed a csv file into a dictionary).

- What was hard about using this technology?
It is very different from other databases. A completely different format can provide confusion; whitelisting IP addresses is a step that could easily be forgotten. Added to the fact that scalability can be difficult; overall, it is no more difficult than working with an SQL dataset.

- What more would you like to learn about it?
I wonder how often this comes up in a data science field; I also wonder what using NewSQL is like.
